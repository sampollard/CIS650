1 Cars Broadcast which lane it wants to enter.
2 Lane with token (1st captain can be chossen randomly) will say permit else wait(Note this has to be done because particular lane should not get the advantage).
3 Car gets inside the lane.
4 Lane checks if we can go straight.

  Tmpassed to next when  both L2 and L1 open are free and has token : moves in ring
  Ts go straight L2 and L1 (when you get it throw when done)
  Tr go right L2 (when you get it throw when done)
  
  For now: Just check if Cz is empty.
  Later: Check if L2 and L1 can be acquired individually.

  If locks acquired send subtoken to Q0 this is hard coded.

  Depending upon if car wants to go straight or right it can pass Tr subtoken to Q3.
